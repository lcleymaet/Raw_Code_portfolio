# Raw_Code_portfolio
A collection of project code that completes various data analysis tasks. The datasets are not included as some are not publicly available and should not be shared. Code is in either R or Python.

Code is specialized to specific datasets. Projects are grouped into individual folders as some projects consist of many different code files due to the nature of the analysis (some scripts may take several hours to run, and separating scripts allowed for piecewise analysis).
