# Raw_Code_portfolio
A collection of project code that completes various data analysis tasks. The datasets are not included as some are not publicly available and should not be shared. Code is in either R or Python.

Code is specialized to specific datasets. Projects are grouped into individual folders as some projects consist of many different code files due to the nature of the analysis (some scripts may take several hours to run, and separating scripts allowed for piecewise analysis).

## e-Bird observation modeling
Files written by me are RasterGrid_LogisticPrep.R, aggregate_and_check.R, ebd_clean.R, gridding.R, and logistic_reg.R. Additionally, write_up.Rmd was largely written by me. Other files are writted by a collaborator on the project.

This project sought to conduct preliminary analysis and determine if it is possible to model e-Bird citizen science database observations in Nevada using limited data. The project includes data cleaning, missing data modeling, logistic regression, and visualization. Findings are detailed in write_up.Rmd, including charts, analyses, and discussion of results. This project is being used as a basis for the analysis that will be conducted in my thesis, where the first part is describing observer bias in the e-Bird database and creating a model that predicts the likelihood of obtaining an observation in any given location.
